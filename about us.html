    <h3><b>Mawlana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani</b></h3>

    <p>Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University has been named after one of the renowned political leaders and philosophers of Bangladesh - <b>Mawlana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani</b> . Today's MBSTU is the outcome of the dream which had been dreamt by him long ago. Mawlana Bhashani had the desire to establish a university that would build its students as independent, honest and hard working citizens. He had proposed the name of this university "Islamic University". Unfortunately his concerns of Islamic University had remained just a dream throughout his lifetime. Long after this spiritual leader`s death, a university named "Islamic University" did establish but this university was established in the district of Kustia instead of Tangail. After waiting a long period of time the Prime Minister of The Peoples Republic of Bangladesh "Sheikh Hasina" founded the foundation-stone of MBSTU at <b><i>Santosh,Tangail in 1999</i></b>.<hr><br><hr>
